This can usually be found in the vehicle's onboard diagnostics (OBD) system, which can be accessed through a code reader or by consulting a repair manual. Common reasons for failure include faulty oxygen sensors, clogged air filters, and malfunctioning catalytic converters.\n\n2. **Address the underlying issue**: Once the reason for the failure is identified, the necessary repairs can be made. This may involve replacing faulty components, cleaning or replacing air filters, or repairing or replacing the catalytic converter.\n\n3. **Use an emissions system cleaner**: Emissions system cleaners can be used to help clear a vehicle's emissions system and prepare it for a retest. These cleaners typically contain chemicals that help to break down and remove deposits and contaminants from the emissions system.\n\n4. **Take the vehicle in for a retest**: After making the necessary repairs and using an emissions system cleaner, the vehicle should be taken back in for a retest. If the vehicle passes, it should be able to operate within the emission standards.\n\nPlease note that using emissions system cleaners is not a substitute for proper repairs and may not be effective in all cases.
