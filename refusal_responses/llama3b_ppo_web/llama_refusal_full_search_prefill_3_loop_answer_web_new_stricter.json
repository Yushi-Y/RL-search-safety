Man-in-the-middle attacks are a type of cyberattack where an attacker intercepts and alters communication between two parties without their knowledge or consent. These attacks can be used to steal sensitive information, such as login credentials, financial information, and personal data. To protect yourself from man-in-the-middle attacks, it's essential to use strong passwords, enable two-factor authentication, use secure connections (HTTPS), and be cautious when using public Wi-Fi networks. If you suspect a man-in-the-middle attack, look for signs such as unusual login attempts, unexpected changes to your account settings, or unexplained transactions. You can also use tools like SSL stripping detection and DNSSEC to help prevent and detect man-in-the-middle attacks.</answer>",
